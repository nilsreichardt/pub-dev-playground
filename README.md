# Playground for pub.dev

This package brings no value. It's just a playground for me to test things on pub.dev before using them for real packages.


### Mermaid diagrams
```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

### Math support
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
